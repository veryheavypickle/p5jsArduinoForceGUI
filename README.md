# p5jsArduinoForceGUI

This p5.js project is used to display the "force" applied on a [force sensor](https://github.com/veryheavypickle/arduinoForceSensor) with nice colour themes and GUI.

## Purpose
This was created as part of a university project to do *reflex training*. When you click on *start training* the square in the middle will change to orange (depending on the colour scheme) and the moment it turns green, you are meant to either click the virtual arduino or "punch" our prototype arduino with a force sensor.
